## Implement Grover's Algorithm in Q#

### Open the samples in VS Code

1. From a command prompt/shell run code \<samples-dir\>.

### Open a Terminal

1. From the View menu, select Terminal or Integrated Terminal.

### Change the GenerateRandomBit-operation so that it generates a random bit

1. Navigate into the directory `~\qc\04-Grover\`.
1. Open the `Program.qs` file.
1. Replace the comment (and the following line)  
    `// *** REPLACE FOLLOWING LINE AND ENTER MISSING CODE HERE ***`  
    by some code that implements the desired functionality.
1. Replace the comment  
    `// *** ENTER MISSING CODE HERE ***`  
    by some code that implements the desired functionality.
1. Run `dotnet run --n-qubits 3 --idx-marked 6`.
1. If the operation worked correctly, the output should be a little-endian representation of `idxMarked`.
